### Southwest Grow House

- Small scale grow operation hideaway nestled in the SW; perfect for a personal little getaway spot to bug out and get off the grid for awhile.
    - Added houses in the woods fit with some essentials for small scale personal grow operations.
    - Dope lil' underground barrel storage concept hidden in the area; will eat the storage contents upon restarts though so be mindful.
